# Fave Platform Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your authentication flow is properly implemented! Here's what you need to do to get it working:

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your actual Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
```

**To get these values:**
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy the Project URL and anon public key

### 2. Run Database Migrations

Run the database migrations in your Supabase project:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the migrations in order:
   - `001_initial_schema.sql`
   - `002_verify_schema.sql`
   - `003_fix_verification_schema.sql`
   - `004_fix_users_schema.sql` (new migration I created)

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

Your authentication flow is correctly implemented:

1. **Signup** → Creates user in Supabase Auth + your users table
2. **Email Verification** → User verifies email
3. **Login** → Authenticates user
4. **KYC Page** → User completes profile setup
5. **Dashboard** → User accesses their role-specific dashboard

## 🛠️ What I Fixed

1. **Database Schema**: Added missing email field to users table
2. **User Creation**: Fixed user creation to sync with Supabase Auth
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in AuthContext
4. **Migration**: Created migration to fix schema mismatch

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/signup`
3. Create an account (select role: creator or fan)
4. Check your email for verification
5. After verification, you'll be redirected to KYC
6. Complete KYC form
7. You'll be redirected to dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see "Configuration Required" error:
- Make sure your `.env` file exists and has correct Supabase credentials
- Restart your development server after adding the `.env` file

### If signup fails:
- Check your Supabase project is active
- Verify your environment variables are correct
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### If KYC doesn't work:
- Make sure you've run all database migrations
- Check that the distributors table has data
- Verify your Supabase RLS policies are set up correctly

## 📊 Database Schema

Your database includes:
- `users` - User accounts and roles
- `user_profiles` - KYC information
- `distributors` - Music distributors for creators
- `projects` - Creator projects
- `token_holdings` - Fan investments
- `transactions` - All platform transactions
- `revenue_payouts` - Revenue distribution

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once you have the basic flow working:
1. Test with different user roles (creator vs fan)
2. Test the KYC form with different distributors
3. Verify dashboard shows correct role-specific content
4. Test the protected routes

Your friend did excellent work on the authentication system! The code is well-structured and follows best practices.
